# ComputerVisionAssignments
Project completed as part of the Computer Vision course for the MSc in Computer Engineering at the University of Palermo, academic year 2024/25.

## Goal: Face Analysis Assignments

This repository contains a collection of practical assignments focused on **face analysis** and **image processing** techniques. The projects explore different aspects of computer vision and machine learning applied to facial images:

1. Assignment 1, **Face Morphing** – Implements geometric transformations and blending techniques to morph one face into another. Students learn how to work with landmarks, Delaunay triangulation, piecewise affine transformations, and intermediate frame generation.

2. Assignment 2, **Face Classification** – Explores face feature extraction and classification. Techniques like Local Binary Patterns (LBP) are applied to detect real vs deepfake faces.

3. Assignment 3, **Real vs AI-Generated Face Detection** – Focuses on deep learning methods to distinguish between real and AI-generated faces. Students construct datasets, design convolutional models with attention mechanisms, and evaluate models using standard classification metrics.
